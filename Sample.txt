Our API has successfully cleared the governance process and has now been fully approved in the API Marketplace, making it available for wider organizational use and consumption. Along with this milestone, the related API documentation has also been reviewed and finalized, ensuring that all technical details, usage guidelines, and integration steps are clearly captured for end users.

In parallel, Splunk onboarding has been completed, which means that all relevant application and API logs are now being captured in real time. This integration allows us to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot effectively, providing greater visibility into system health, performance, and compliance. The observed results and dashboards are documented, enabling seamless tracking and reporting.
